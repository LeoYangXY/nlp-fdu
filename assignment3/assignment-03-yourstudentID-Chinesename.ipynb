    "> 1. Rename assignment-03-###-###.ipynb where ### is your student ID and your name (Chinese).\n",
    "> 2. The deadline of Assignment-03 is 23:59pm, 04-30-2025\n",
    "> 3. Submit a single ZIP archive that includes every file you downloaded. You only need to modify transformer.py, run the Jupyter notebook, and save the resulting performance output inside the archive.\n",
    "> 4. The primary goal of this assignment is to give you hands-on experience implementing a Transformer model.\n",

    "## Task\n",
    "> In this assignment, you will train a Transformer model to count letters. Given a string of characters, your task is to predict, for each position in the string, how many times the character at that position occurred previously, maxing out at 2. This is a 3-class classification task (with labels 0, 1, or > 2, which we’ll just denote as 2). This task is easy with a rule-based system, but it is not so easy for a model to learn. However, Transformers are ideally set up to be able to “look back” with self-attention to count occurrences in the context. Below is an example string (x) (which ends in a trailing space) and its corresponding labels (y):\n",
    "> - x: i like movies a lot\n",
    "> - y: 00010010002102021102\n",
    ">  \n",
    "> If your implementation is correct, then ```python letter_counting.py --task BEFORE```\n",
    "> gives a reasonable output (accuracy will be above 90%).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> We also present a modified version of this task that counts both occurrences of letters before and after in the sequence:\n",
    "> - x: i like movies a lot\n",
    "> - y: 22120120102102021102\n",
    ">  \n",
    "> If your implementation is correct, then ```python letter_counting.py --task BEFOREAFTER ``` gives a reasonable output (accuracy will be above 90%)."

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset for this homework is derived from the text8 collection, which comes from Wikipedia. Your method will use character-level tokenization and operate over text8 sequences that are each exactly 20 characters long. Only 27 character types are present (lowercase characters and spaces); special characters are replaced by a single space and numbers are spelled out as individual digits (50 becomes five zero). Part of examples are:\n",

    "> The dataset is in lettercounting-train.txt and lettercounting-dev.txt. Both two files contain character strings of length 20. You can assume that your model will always see 20 characters as input and make a prediction at each position in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code\n",
    "\n",
    "> The framework code you are given consists of several files.\n",
    "> 1. *utils.py*: it implements an Indexer class, which can be used to maintain a bijective mapping between indices and features (strings).\n",
    "> 2. *letter_counting.py*: contains the driver code, which imports transformer.py, the file you will be editing for this assignment.\n",
    "> 3. *transformer.py*: **You need to fill out all missing parts. Note that your solutions should not use nn.TransformerEncoder, nn.TransformerDecoder, or any other off-the-shelf self-attention layers. You can use nn.Linear, nn.Embedding, and PyTorch’s provided nonlinearities / loss functions to implement Transformers from scratch.**\n"
